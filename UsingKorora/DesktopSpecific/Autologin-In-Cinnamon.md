# Autologin in Cinnamon

When you start your Korora system it takes you to the LightDM so you can enter your password and start Cinnamon. However if you are the only user of the system you may prefer to bypass this screen and have Korora go straight to the desktop.

As Cinnamon uses LightDM as the default Display Manager see the [Autologin In LightDM documentation page](https://github.com/kororaproject/kp-documentation/wiki/Autologin-in-LightDM) to configure Autologin.
